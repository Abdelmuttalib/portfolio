          A major feature I have worked on is the ads feature for the website, I

          the ads feature would allow the seller to make ads/offers for their
          services for a specific period of time as an exclusive offers, and the
          buyer would be able to see the ad and the ad details and contact the

          Challenges when working with a team is that you have to communicate

          part of the project and not leaving it to the other team members, and
          you have to make sure that you are not stepping on the other team
          members&apos; toes.

          Challenges when working on the ads feature is that I had to ensure
          that the ads pages are SEO friendly, to be able to attract more users
          from google searches. I also had to work closely with the backend
          developers and ensure that the backend implementation reflects the
          business logic and how the ads feature should work. I also made sure
          to make it easy for users to understand the ads feature and how they
          can use it for their advantage

          On my average day of work, I start the day off by checking my emails.

          over my to-do list and get started on the projects that have my top
          priority. I spend most of my morning reviewing merge requests and
          approving some of them that cannot be improved further. I find that I
          am most creative and productive in the morning, which is why I like to
          review merge requests and do brainstorming for solutions to my current
          tasks right away.
